Evidence is provided here of the following objectives:
1. Explain communication concepts and strategies
- We learn this Communication concept in week 1 and in this I learn channels which have source and receiver.
- Source will send message to receiver and then Receiver will give Response as a Feedback.
- For example we can see [this Image](https://github.com/Ujjwalsavaliya/ePortfolio/blob/31e78ae54409da630d6411285a2566a990a7759a/ICT/communication%20concept%20and%20strategy.jpg?raw=true)
2. Show confidence and skills in oral communications and presentations
- In Oral communications and Presentation I had given a presentation which is [ICT](https://github.com/Ujjwalsavaliya/ePortfolio/blob/main/ICT/Cybersafety%20&%20Indigenous%20Australians.pptx?raw=true).
- In this presentation my Topic was Cyber safety and Indegeneous Australians.
- I speak this Presentation about 10 minutes. Although, it was my first experience but still I tried my best to give presentation.
3. Work effectively as part of a team
- We had done work as a part of team in 2 weeks. 
- It was a great engagement with my classmates.
- while having group work we always encourage each other and supports all team member work.
4. Communicate effectively in a professional context

5. Define and demonstrate conflict management and resolution strategies.
- This conflict management skill involves using different tactics depending on the situation, negotiation, and creative thinking. With properly managed conflict, an organization is able to minimize interpersonal issues, enhance client satisfaction, and produce better business outcomes.
- Conflict resolution can be defined as the informal or formal process that two or more parties use to find a peaceful solution to their dispute.
